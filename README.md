# TFHoldings
Interview for Senior Risk Analyst at TFHoldings; Would have worked with a new Unsecured Product in Illinois that would serve a primarily bi-lingual population of people that don't have credit histories or credit data available.  

Interviews:

Initial:
30 Minute HR Screen
30 Minute Mental Aptitude Test?
45 Minute Case Study
~2 hours *Take home Case Study 72 hours to Complete* # My opinion is they shouldn't assign something that takes more than 2 hours to complete so I limit myself to that

Final Round:
45-60 Minute Case Study
45-60 Minute Interview with COO
45-60 Minute Interview with Project Manager

$115K/Year, about 2 years of Experience.

>> 6 hour interview for them to end up not even providing feedback. Seemed like a shady company from reviewing posts online and the producy seems predatory. That leads me to dox the data and project they sent me. Enjoy.
